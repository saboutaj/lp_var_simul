# Simulation study of Local Projections, VARs, and related estimators

Matlab code for large-scale simulation studies of impulse response estimators, including Local Projections (LPs), Vector Autoregressions (VARs), and several variants of these

Tested in: Matlab R2020a on Windows 10 PC (64-bit)

**Acknowledgements:**
We rely on penalized LP code by [Regis Barnichon & Christian Brownless](https://github.com/ctbrownlees/MATLAB-package-lproj), as well as VAR model averaging code by [Bruce Hansen](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/progs/var.html). We have slightly modified both of these sets of codes to improve their run-time without affecting their numerical output.
