Tested in: Matlab R2020a on Windows 10 PC (64-bit)

**Acknowledgements:**
We rely on penalized LP code by [Regis Barnichon & Christian Brownless](https://github.com/ctbrownlees/MATLAB-package-lproj), as well as VAR model averaging code by [Bruce Hansen](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/progs/var.html). We have slightly modified both of these sets of codes to improve their run-time without affecting their numerical output. We also use Dynamic Factor Model code and data by [Eben Lazarus, Daniel Lewis, Jim Stock & Mark Watson](http://www.princeton.edu/~mwatson/ddisk/LLSW_ReplicationFiles_071418.zip).
